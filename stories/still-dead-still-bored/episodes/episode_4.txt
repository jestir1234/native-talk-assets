The air in Tokyo buzzed. It was Golden Week, a time when the whole city seemed to breathe out a sigh of joy and rush into the streets. Everywhere Zoey looked, there were families laughing, friends taking photos, and couples holding hands. Flags fluttered from buildings, and the smell of street food mixed with the sweet scent of spring flowers.

Zoey watched from a quiet park bench. People moved like a colorful river, flowing past her. She saw their bright smiles, their excited chatter. "How much energy they have," she thought, a small, dry smile touching her lips. "Like little wind-up toys, running until their springs break."

She had seen many Golden Weeks. Too many. Four hundred years of spring festivals, summer fireworks, autumn leaves, and winter snows. Each year, the faces changed, but the joy, the hope, the fleeting happiness – it was always the same. And it always passed.

A group of teenagers passed by, shouting with laughter. One of them, a girl with bright pink hair, tripped but caught herself, laughing even harder. Zoey watched her, a strange feeling in her chest. Not quite envy, but a distant, quiet sadness. To be so alive, so clumsy, so full of small, unimportant moments that felt like the entire world.

Zoey sighed. Her own world was vast and unchanging. It was full of memories, like dust motes in an empty room. She remembered festivals from the Edo period, from the Meiji era, from wartime Tokyo. People had danced, eaten, and celebrated then too, just like now. And they were all gone. All of them.

Her phone buzzed. It was Haruka, her best friend.
"Zoey! Are you out? The city is amazing! Let's get some yakisoba, I saw a great stall near Shibuya Crossing!" Haruka’s voice was full of sunshine, even through the phone.

"Maybe later, Haruka," Zoey replied, trying to sound cheerful. It was a good mask, one she had practiced for centuries. "I'm enjoying the quiet here."

Haruka’s voice dropped slightly. "Quiet? Zoey, it's Golden Week! Don't be such a hermit!"

"Just enjoying the view," Zoey said, looking at a father trying to balance his giggling child on his shoulders. "Everyone seems very happy."

"You should be happy too!" Haruka insisted. "Come on!"

"I'll think about it," Zoey promised, knowing she wouldn't. She needed to keep her energy up, but not the human kind of energy. Her kind of energy was a deep, dull ache that only raw meat could fix. The thought reminded her to text Kenji, the butcher who secretly helped her. *Need a package later.* Simple, direct. He would understand.

Later, as the sun began to set, painting the sky in fiery oranges and purples, the celebrations grew louder. Music drifted from open-air concerts, and the smell of grilling food filled the air. Zoey walked through the busy streets, a silent observer in a world full of noise. She saw a young couple sharing a bento box, their faces lit by the glow of lanterns. She saw an old woman sitting alone, watching the crowds with a soft smile.

"They chase these moments so hard," Zoey thought, watching a group of friends trying to take a perfect selfie. "As if they can hold onto them forever."

She knew better. Forever was a long, lonely road. And these bright, shining moments, like fireworks, would explode in glory and then vanish into the darkness. She was the darkness, watching the show. She couldn't join their dance, couldn't feel their light. Not truly. Her heart, what was left of it, was too old, too tired.

She stopped in front of a bookstore, its windows glowing warmly. Inside, Takashi, the owner, was tidying a shelf, a calm look on his face. He seemed like a quiet island in the sea of noise. Zoey felt a tiny, almost forgotten pull towards his peaceful presence. But she quickly pushed it away. What was the point? He was a fleeting spark. She was a permanent shadow.

She turned away from the bookstore, walking down a quieter side street. The sounds of Golden Week faded behind her, replaced by the soft hum of distant traffic. It was better this way. To observe, to note, to acknowledge the joy, and then to let it go. It was their joy, not hers. And she, the undying, decaying thing, would simply wait for it all to fade. Just as it always did. The thought was both sad and, in a strange way, comforting.
