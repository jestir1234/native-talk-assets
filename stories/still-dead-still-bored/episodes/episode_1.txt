The morning light filtered through Zoey’s Tokyo apartment window, not quite bright enough to chase away the deep grey of the city’s concrete. She opened her eyes, ready for another day of polite faking and existential boredom. But today, something was different.

It started with a faint smell, like dust and old wood. Then a sound, thin and reedy, like a forgotten lullaby. And then, a picture flashed behind her eyes: a small room, sun-drenched, with a single, intricately carved wooden box on a low table. The feeling that came with it was a sharp, sudden ache, like a phantom limb.

Zoey blinked. A memory? Not of a grand historical event she’d witnessed, or a language she’d learned in a forgotten empire. This felt... personal. Human.

"Oh, for the love of…," she muttered, pushing herself up. Her brain, that old, slow-rotting organ, was clearly having a bad day. Usually, her human past was a blank, a convenient void. But today, it was insistent, like a stubborn toddler.

She made coffee, though the caffeine was more for show. What was the point when your heart didn’t beat? The image of the wooden box persisted, swirling with the phantom dust smell. It was annoying. Like a tiny, ancient splinter in her immortal mind.

As she dressed, a new fragment surfaced: a specific pattern on a ceramic bowl, blue and white. And the word, whispered in a voice that wasn't hers, yet felt deeply familiar: *Ushigome*.

Ushigome. An old district. A quiet, residential area now, but historically, it had been home to many old samurai estates and merchant families. "Great," Zoey sighed, pulling on her jacket. "My brain wants to play archeologist with its own decaying contents. How utterly morbid."

The compulsion was surprisingly strong. It wasn't logic, but a deep, unsettling itch. She had to find it. Or at least, try. Maybe then her brain would shut up.

First, a stop at Kenji’s butcher shop. He greeted her with his usual knowing smile. "Morning, Zoey-san. The usual?"

"And then some," she said, nodding towards a particularly dark cut of beef. "Feeling a bit… nostalgic today." Kenji just chuckled, bagging the meat. He never asked questions, which was why he was so useful.

Armed with her package, Zoey headed to the National Diet Library. A long shot, but if she needed to find old architectural layouts or family names tied to Ushigome, this was the place. She walked past Takashi’s bookstore, glancing inside. He was arranging new arrivals, a peaceful, focused look on his face. He’d probably find her current quest entirely depressing. She liked that about him. She kept walking.

Inside the library, Zoey, with her perfect recall and ability to skim texts at incredible speeds, dove into old Tokyo city maps and historical property records. The dusty smell here was real, not a memory. She found mention of a small, forgotten temple, Hōjō-ji, nestled deep in a residential part of Ushigome, known for its specific type of ceramic art donated by old merchant families.

"Ceramic bowls, huh?" she murmured to herself. This was getting ridiculous.

The temple was small, hidden behind modern houses, almost swallowed by overgrown trees. It felt quiet, left behind. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and something else… incense, very old and faded.

She pushed open the heavy wooden gate. The main hall was simple, elegant. Inside, on a low altar, among a few worn offerings, stood a single ceramic bowl. Blue and white. The pattern was exact.

Her rotting brain chose that moment to throw another, stronger fragment at her. Not an image this time, but a sensation: the feeling of kneeling, small and young, before this very bowl. A soft hand on her shoulder. A voice, whispering comfort. The name *Ushigome* now felt like a warm, forgotten blanket, not just a place.

And with the comfort, came the ache again. A different kind of ache. The ache of something precious, long gone. Something that broke.

Zoey stood there for a long time, looking at the bowl. It wasn’t a grand revelation. There was no secret message, no hidden clue to a lost identity. Just a bowl. And a feeling. A feeling of *being* there, once. Of a life lived, broken, and then forgotten.

It was profoundly anticlimactic, and profoundly sad.

"Well," she whispered to the empty temple, "that was a waste of four hundred years of forgetting."

On her way home, she saw Haruka walking out of a café, laughing with a friend. Haruka waved, bright and cheerful. Zoey managed a small, tired smile back. Haruka would never understand this kind of melancholy scavenger hunt. She would just ask if Zoey was having a bad day and suggest shopping.

Back in her quiet apartment, Zoey unwrapped the meat Kenji had given her. It was dark, rich, and exactly what she needed. As she ate, the fragmented memories seemed to recede, leaving behind only a faint echo.

The echo of empty rooms. Empty rooms where a small, human girl once knelt. Empty rooms in her mind, now briefly filled, then emptied again.

"Some things," Zoey thought, wiping a trickle of blood from her lip, "are probably better off staying buried." She tossed the wrapper into the bin, the rustle of paper sounding loud in the silence. The city outside hummed, full of lives being lived, forgotten, or not yet begun. And Zoey, the 400-year-old zombie, just kept going. What else was there to do?
