Zoey walked slowly. Tokyo was a busy river of people. Cars rushed past like metal fish. The sun was hot, even in the shade of tall buildings. Zoey felt a familiar weight inside her chest. Not hunger for meat, not pain. Justâ€¦ boredom. And something older, deeper.

She saw a small sign: "Vintage Kimono Shop." The door was old wood, inviting. Zoey stepped inside. The air was cool, quiet. It smelled of old silk, dust, and something like forgotten dreams.

Rows of beautiful kimonos hung. Each one was a soft ghost of a past life. Colours were soft, faded. Patterns whispered stories from long ago. Zoey touched a sleeve. The silk was cool under her fingers. Like a second skin, but not hers. She liked places like this. They held history, but did not ask for her own.

Her eyes moved over the rich fabrics. Then they stopped. On a low table, folded neatly, was an *obi*. A long, wide sash used to tie a kimono. This one was special. It was made of deep red silk, very fine. Woven into the silk were small, delicate plum blossoms, white and pink. They seemed to float.

Zoey reached out. Her fingers, pale and smooth, touched the silk. It felt just like she remembered. Too much like she remembered.

Suddenly, the shop faded. The cool air was gone. Zoey was standing in a different place. The smell of cherry blossoms was in the air, not plum, but still spring. Fireflies danced in the warm evening. Laughter echoed from far away. She was not Zoey Yamashita now. She was younger, with a name long forgotten. She was alive.

She was wearing a kimono, a beautiful one. And around her waist, tied by her mother's careful hands, was *this* obi. The red silk with the plum blossoms. Her heart felt so light, so full of hope.

A young man stood beside her. His hand was warm in hers. "Next spring," he said, his voice soft. "We will build our house near the river. We will plant plum trees, just for you." He smiled, his eyes kind. "And we will watch our children grow under their shade."

She smiled back, her cheeks warm. She felt happy. A simple, human happiness. A future, clear like water. A future with a house, plum trees, children. A life that would grow old, slowly, naturally, with love.

*Thump.*

Zoey was back in the quiet shop. The obi was still on the table. The plum blossoms still floated on the red silk. But the young man was gone. The house, the plum trees, the children. All gone. For 400 years.

She looked at her hand. It was not warm and soft like in the memory. It was cool, unfeeling. It would never grow old. It would never wrinkle. It would never show the passing of years, the signs of a life lived. It would stay like this, forever. Undead.

"A future," Zoey thought, her inner voice dry. "What a beautiful thing to look forward to." She almost laughed. A short, bitter sound that did not leave her lips. Her own future had ended before it truly began. It had not decayed. It had just stopped. Frozen. Like her body.

She was a memory, a living ghost. The obi was a ghost of silk. It had a long history, but it had not lost its beauty. Her body had a long history, too, but it had lost its ability to live. To change. To die.

The shop owner, a kind old woman, walked by. She smiled at Zoey. "It's beautiful, isn't it?" she asked softly, looking at the obi. "From the Edo period. Very rare."

Zoey nodded slowly. "Yes," she said. Her voice was steady, calm. No one would know the storm inside her. "Very rare."

She gently put the obi back on the table. It was for someone else. Someone who still had a future. Someone who could still grow old, naturally, beautifully. Someone who could still decay in the right way.

Zoey turned and walked out of the shop. The bright Tokyo street was suddenly too loud, too bright. The future was still rushing by. But it was not hers. It was never hers. And it would never be.
