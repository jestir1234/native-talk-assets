Zoey woke up. Another day. The Tokyo sun was bright, but to Zoey, it was just another light. Four hundred years of sunrises meant they were not special. She felt the dull ache in her bones – not a real ache, but a memory of one. A ghost of pain from a life long past. She needed meat. Her body needed it to look human, to stay warm, to keep her skin from looking like old paper.

She walked through the quiet backstreets. Older houses, small gardens. Not many people. Then she saw it. A dog. Old, brown fur, matted and dirty. It lay near a small tree, not moving much. Its eyes were open, but they looked very tired. Too tired. This dog was dying.

Zoey stopped. Her first thought, quick as a blink, was practical: *No, not that kind of meat.* Her stomach rumbled, a silent joke. A truly terrible joke. She looked at the dog again. It gave a soft, weak cough. It was just an animal, but its life was ending. She had seen millions of deaths. People, animals, cities. So why did this one feel different? Maybe because it reminded her of things she could not feel herself: true weakness, a final end. She had decaying compassion, yes. A strange, old feeling.

"Hello," Zoey said softly. The dog didn't move much, just blinked. She knelt down. No collar, no tag. "Lost, huh?" She checked its ear. Nothing. Just an old dog, alone. Zoey stood up. She looked around. No posters. No one walking around calling "Fido!" or "Buddy!" She sighed. This was not her problem. But she stayed. A small part of her, the part that remembered being human, wanted to help. It was a strange feeling, like an old coin found in a dusty box.

She picked up the dog carefully. It was light, so light. Its breathing was shallow. "Okay, old friend," she murmured. "Let's see." She walked slowly, looking at every house. She looked for a gate left open, a child’s drawing of a dog. Nothing. People walked past her, busy, looking at their phones. They did not see the dying dog in her arms, or they pretended not to. Zoey felt a familiar sense of distance. She was always on the outside looking in.

The dog shivered slightly. Its eyes were almost closed now. Zoey walked to a small park. She sat on a bench. The sun felt warm. "You're going to a quiet place," she whispered to the dog. "A place I cannot go." She remembered other dying things. Battlefields, plagues, old friends on their deathbeds. She had always stayed the same. It was lonely, being the one who never left. This dog would soon be truly free. She felt a strange envy.

She stroked the dog's head. Its fur was rough but soft. The warmth left its body slowly. Zoey felt its last breath, a tiny puff against her hand. Then, nothing. Stillness. The world kept moving around them. Children laughed in the distance. A bird sang. The dog was gone.

Zoey sat there for a long time. The dog was truly gone. Finished. Its short life was over. She, on the other hand, would continue. She would walk home, eat meat, pretend to be a young woman, and feel nothing new. The dog had a beginning and an end. Zoey had only a beginning that never ended. She looked at her hands. They looked human, but they were not. They had held so much life, and so much death. And still, they were here. She carefully laid the dog under the tree, near some flowers. A small farewell. Then she stood up and walked away, back to her endless day, a quiet sadness heavier than usual. Her reanimated heart felt a faint, echoing throb for a life that could truly end.
