It was a busy morning at the coffee shop. Maya cleaned the tables. She saw something small. It was on a chair. A teddy bear. It looked old. It was loved very much. One ear was a little loose.

Maya picked it up. "Oh no," she thought. "Someone is sad without you." She put the bear on the counter. It was near the cash machine. Maybe the owner would come back soon.

Alex, her friend, walked to her. "What is this little friend doing here?" he asked. Maya told him about the bear. Alex said, "Let's put a sign." Maya agreed. She wrote: "Found: A teddy bear. Is it yours?"

Many customers came. Many customers went. They saw the bear. Mr. Tanaka came for his hot tea. He saw the bear. "Ah, a friend is lost," he said quietly. He told Maya a story. When he was a boy, he lost his toy car. It was lost for one week. Then he found it. Maya smiled.

Sarah, the busy woman, stopped. She looked at the bear. "My little girl has a bear like this," she said. "It is her best toy."

Maya told everyone about the lost bear. "Please tell your friends," she asked. "A child must be very sad now."

In the afternoon, a woman came into the shop. She looked worried. A little girl was with her. Maybe she was five years old. The girl's eyes were red from crying. "Excuse me," the woman said to Maya. "Did you see a teddy bear?"

Maya pointed to the counter. The little girl saw it. Her eyes opened wide. "Teddy!" she cried loudly. She ran and hugged the bear very, very tight.

The mother thanked Maya many times. "She cried all morning," she said. "Thank you for keeping him safe." Maya felt happy inside.

Alex smiled. "See, Maya?" he said. "Even a small bear can bring people together." Maya agreed. Her coffee shop was more than just a place for coffee. It was a place for friends, for small happy moments. It was a place for hearts that were lost, and then found.
