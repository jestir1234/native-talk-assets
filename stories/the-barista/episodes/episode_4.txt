Maya, a barista at The Daily Grind, smiled. The coffee shop was warm and busy. She loved the smell of coffee and baked bread.

Alex, her best friend and another barista, laughed. "Big rush today!" he said.

An old lady walked in. It was Mrs. Gable. She came every day. She always ordered Earl Grey tea. She sat at her small, quiet table.

Maya walked to her table. "Good morning, Mrs. Gable. The usual Earl Grey?"

Mrs. Gable smiled softly. "Yes, dear. But... this will be my last one."

Maya stopped. "Last one? Are you going on a trip?"

Mrs. Gable shook her head. "No. I am moving. Far away. To live with my daughter in another state."

Maya felt a little sad inside. Mrs. Gable was quiet, but she was kind. She always listened when Maya talked about her day.

Maya went to make the tea. She made it perfect. Hot water, a fresh Earl Grey tea bag. A thin slice of lemon, just how Mrs. Gable liked it.

Alex saw Maya's sad face. "What's wrong?" he asked. Maya told him. "Mrs. Gable is moving." Alex looked sad too. Carlos, the owner, heard them. He walked over. "Oh, Mrs. Gable! We will miss you so much!" he said with a warm smile.

Maya brought the tea to Mrs. Gable. "Here you go, Mrs. Gable. The best Earl Grey."

Mrs. Gable took a small sip. "It is perfect, Maya. Thank you for everything."

She stood up slowly. "Goodbye, Maya. Goodbye, Alex. Goodbye, Carlos." She waved gently. Maya waved back. Her eyes felt a little wet.

Later, the shop was quiet. Maya looked at Mrs. Gable's empty table. It felt strange. People come and go, she thought. Life changes. But The Daily Grind is always here. And the friendships they make, they stay in her heart.

The bell jingled. Sarah, the busy businesswoman, walked in. "Coffee, Maya, please! I had a very hard morning."

Maya smiled. "Coming right up, Sarah!" The day continued.
