Maya smiled. Today was important! The Brooklyn Barista Bash was tonight. Maya had special coffee beans for it. Very special. Limited edition. She kept them safe, in a blue bag, on the top shelf at The Daily Grind. She wanted to make a perfect coffee for the Bash.

Maya went to get the blue bag. She looked up. No blue bag! Her smile went away. Her heart felt fast. "Where are my beans?" she thought. She looked again. Nothing. The top shelf was empty.

Alex came over. "What's wrong, Maya?" Alex asked.
"My beans! The Barista Bash beans! They are gone!" Maya said, very worried.
Alex looked too. "Hmm, I didn't see them. Did you move them?"
"No! I put them here yesterday," Maya said, pointing to the empty shelf.

Maya looked behind the counter. She looked under the counter. No beans.
Mr. Tanaka walked in. He waved. "Good morning, Maya!" he said, smiling.
Maya smiled back, but her mind was still on the beans.
Sarah came for her usual big latte. "Busy day, Maya?" she asked.
"Very busy!" Maya said, still searching.

Then Maya saw Emma, the food blogger. Emma was taking pictures of a new pastry.
"Emma, did you see a blue bag of special beans?" Maya asked.
Emma looked up. "Oh, a blue bag? Yes! Carlos moved a blue bag. He said it was 'for safekeeping' from spilled milk. He put it in the back, near the new storage shelf."

Maya ran to the back room. Carlos was talking on the phone.
"Carlos! My beans?" Maya asked, a little out of breath.
Carlos pointed to a shelf. "Ah, the special beans! I moved them this morning. A small milk spill happened. I put them in the dry spot. Safe!"
Maya saw the blue bag. There it was! Safe and sound. She picked it up. She hugged the bag. "Thank you, Carlos! Thank you!"
Carlos smiled. "No problem, Maya. Good luck tonight!"
Maya smiled big again. Her special beans were safe. The Barista Bash was still on! She could make the perfect coffee. Today was important again.
