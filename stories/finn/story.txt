1 Finn loved to lie in the grass and watch the clouds drift lazily across the blue sky.
2 He imagined that each cloud was a ship sailing toward faraway lands.
3 One morning, he folded a paper boat from an old map his grandfather had given him.
4 "Every adventure starts with a small step," his grandfather's words echoed in his mind.
5 Finn placed the little boat on the pond and gave it a tiny push.
6 The boat bobbed once, twice—and began to shimmer with golden light.
7 The paper unfolded itself into tall, billowing sails that smelled like rain.
8 "Come aboard, Finn!" whispered a voice that seemed to come from the wind itself.
9 Heart pounding, Finn stepped onto the glowing deck, and the boat rose gently into the air.
10 The trees below grew smaller and smaller until they looked like tiny green dots.
11 Through the clouds, Finn saw something extraordinary—a floating island covered in flowers and waterfalls that spilled into the sky.
12 When he landed, the soft grass beneath his feet sparkled as if filled with starlight.
13 Friendly birds circled above him, singing his name in cheerful songs.
14 He met a silver fox made of wind and sunlight, whose fur shimmered like morning dew.
15 "Welcome, traveler," said the fox. "The island moves wherever the world needs a dream."
16 Together, they watched the island drift across the horizon, touching sunsets and mountain peaks.
17 Finn wanted to take a golden flower home, but when he reached out, it turned into warm light and vanished.
18 "Some things stay with us even when we can't see them," the fox said gently.
19 The island began to fade into the clouds as the wind carried Finn back to his pond.
20 When he opened his eyes, the paper boat floated softly on the water—and Finn smiled, knowing he had truly sailed the sky.
