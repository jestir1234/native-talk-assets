You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Korean-language story about Mina, a 16-year-old high school student in Seoul who is navigating the subway system for the first time alone.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to Mina and her first subway adventure in an interesting way. 

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
