You are writing the first episode in a serialized Korean-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Mina (미나)
- Age: 16 years old
- Location: Seoul, South Korea
- Job: High school student
- Personality: Nervous but determined, polite, observant, learning Korean subway culture
- Background: First time navigating the Seoul subway system alone, meeting a friend at Hongdae station

Tone: Quiet, introspective, sometimes nervous or anxious. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents. Include Korean cultural details and subway-specific language learning moments.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Korean**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe Mina's first experience navigating the Seoul subway system alone. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
