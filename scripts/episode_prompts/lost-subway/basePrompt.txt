You are writing the next episode in a serialized Korean-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Mina (미나)
- Age: 16 years old
- Location: Seoul, South Korea
- Job: High school student
- Personality: Nervous but determined, polite, observant, learning Korean subway culture
- Background: First time navigating the Seoul subway system alone, meeting a friend at Hongdae station

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents. Include Korean cultural details and subway-specific language learning moments.

Write the Episode entirely in **Korean**. It should be 400–600 characters long.
