You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Korean-language story about Mina, a 16-year-old high school student in Seoul who is navigating the subway system for the first time alone.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

Now, come up with the next episode idea. It should feel like the natural next chapter in an ongoing story about Mina's subway adventure. It can deepen her understanding of Korean culture, introduce new challenges with the subway system, or expand on her growing confidence — but should avoid wrapping up the entire story.

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
