A 16-year-old Korean girl sitting on a different Seoul subway train, looking confused at the subway map with different colored lines. She's mumbling "길을 잃었어요…" (I'm lost...) to herself. A group of Korean high school students sitting nearby are looking at her with concern and starting to offer help. The train has a different color scheme and line number visible. The girl is dressed in a school uniform and has a worried expression. Korean subway announcements can be seen on the display screens. The scene captures the confusion of being on the wrong train line and the kindness of Korean youth offering assistance.
