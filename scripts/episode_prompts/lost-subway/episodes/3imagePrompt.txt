A large, bustling Seoul subway station with a 16-year-old Korean girl looking overwhelmed and confused. She's surrounded by crowds of commuters and multiple escalators and signs in Korean. An elderly Korean woman is gesturing urgently toward an escalator, saying "빨리 가요!" (Hurry up!). The station has high ceilings, bright lighting, and multiple levels visible. The girl is dressed in a school uniform and has a lost expression. Korean signage and subway maps are visible throughout the station. The scene captures the sensory overload of a large subway station and the urgency of following directions.
