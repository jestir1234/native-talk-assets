A 16-year-old Korean girl standing nervously at a Seoul subway station, studying a large subway map on the wall. She has a determined but anxious expression as she points to "홍대입구역" (Hongdae station) on the map. The station is busy with commuters, and subway trains can be seen in the background. The girl is dressed in a school uniform and holds a small bag. The lighting is bright and modern, typical of Seoul's subway stations. The scene captures her first-time independence and the overwhelming complexity of the subway system.
