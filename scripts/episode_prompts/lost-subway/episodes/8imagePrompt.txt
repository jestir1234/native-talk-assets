A 16-year-old Korean girl talking to a Seoul subway worker in uniform at a station. The worker is pointing to a subway map and explaining an alternative route using Line 6. The girl has a trusting but confused expression as she listens to the directions. Korean subway signage and maps are visible on the walls. The station has a modern, clean appearance typical of Seoul's subway system. The worker is gesturing and repeating "여기에서 6호선 타세요" (Take Line 6 from here). The scene captures the helpfulness of Korean subway workers and the girl's willingness to trust directions despite her uncertainty.
