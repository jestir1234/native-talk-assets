A 16-year-old Korean girl sitting on a Seoul subway train, leaning forward to politely ask a passenger for help. She has a worried expression and is pointing to the subway map above the door. The passenger, a middle-aged Korean woman, looks concerned and is gesturing to indicate they've passed the destination. Other commuters can be seen in the background. The train interior is clean and modern with Korean signage visible. The girl is dressed in a school uniform and holds her bag tightly. The scene captures the cultural politeness of asking strangers for help and the growing realization of being lost.
