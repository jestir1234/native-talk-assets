A 16-year-old Korean girl sitting with a group of Korean high school students on a Seoul subway train. The students are teaching her subway vocabulary, with one student drawing a mini map on a piece of paper. Korean snacks from subway kiosks are visible on the seat beside them. The girl has a focused, learning expression as she practices saying "갈아타다" (to transfer) and "몇 호선이에요?" (Which line is it?). The train interior is bright and modern with Korean signage. The scene captures the cultural exchange and educational moment, showing Korean youth helping a stranger learn their language and subway system.
