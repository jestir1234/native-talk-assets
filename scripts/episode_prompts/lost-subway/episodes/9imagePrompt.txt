A 16-year-old Korean girl sitting on a Line 6 Seoul subway train with a helpful passenger. The passenger, a middle-aged Korean person, is explaining how to reverse direction and get back to Seoul. The girl has a hopeful, grateful expression as she practices saying "실례합니다, ○○역에 가려면 어떻게 가야 해요?" (Excuse me, how do I get to ○○ station?). The train interior shows Line 6's distinctive color scheme. Korean subway announcements and signage are visible. The scene captures the kindness of Korean people offering help without being asked and the girl's growing confidence in using Korean language.
