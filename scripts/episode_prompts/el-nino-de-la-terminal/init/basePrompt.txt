You are writing the first episode in a serialized Spanish-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Miguel
- Age: 8 years old
- Location: JFK Airport, New York
- Job: Elementary school student (spends days at airport kids play area)
- Personality: Curious, imaginative, independent, observant, sometimes lonely but resourceful
- Background: Lives with his mother Maria who works as a janitor at JFK airport. Spends his days at the airport's kids play area while his mother works, making friends with travelers and airport staff.

Tone: Quiet, introspective, sometimes dry or melancholic. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Spanish**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Miguel's life involving ${FIRST_EPISODE_HOOK}. Set the mood, introduce his voice, and hint at his emotional state. No need to explain everything—let his character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
