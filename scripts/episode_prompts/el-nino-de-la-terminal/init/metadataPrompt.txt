You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Spanish-language story about Miguel, an 8-year-old Latino boy in JFK Airport who spends his days at the kids play area while his mother works as a janitor.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to the character in an interesting way. 

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
