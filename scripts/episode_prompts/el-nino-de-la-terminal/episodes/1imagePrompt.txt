A bright, colorful kids play area inside JFK Airport terminal. An 8-year-old Latino boy with dark hair and curious brown eyes sits alone, watching other children play with their families. In the background, his mother in a janitor's uniform works quietly, cleaning nearby. The scene shows the contrast between the bustling airport environment and the boy's solitude. Bright airport lighting, diverse travelers in the background, and the boy's observant expression as he watches his mother being spoken to by a passenger. The play area is colorful and inviting, but the boy appears thoughtful and slightly isolated.
