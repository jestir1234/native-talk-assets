A quiet, dimly lit airport terminal at night. Miguel is hiding behind a pillar, watching his mother work as a janitor. She is polishing chairs and floors, completely unnoticed by the few remaining travelers who walk past without seeing her. The scene shows the contrast between the bright, bustling daytime airport and this quiet, almost invisible night work. Miguel's expression shows his growing understanding of his mother's invisibility. The lighting is soft and atmospheric, emphasizing the solitude and dignity of his mother's work. The empty terminal creates a sense of isolation and the parallel between his mother and the furniture she maintains.
