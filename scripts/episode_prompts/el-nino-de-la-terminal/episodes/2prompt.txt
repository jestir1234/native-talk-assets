You are writing Episode 2 of "El ni√±o de la terminal" - a coming-of-age story about Miguel, an 8-year-old boy who spends his days at the JFK Airport kids play area while his mother works as a janitor. Write the story in Spanish from Miguel's first-person perspective.

CHARACTERS:
- Miguel: 8-year-old Latino boy, curious, imaginative, independent, observant
- Maria: Miguel's mother, works as a janitor at JFK Airport
- Various travelers and airport staff who come and go

EPISODE 2: "Ecos en la terminal"
Setting: JFK Airport, New York - various areas of the terminal as Miguel observes the rhythms

Write a 200-300 word episode that shows:
1. Miguel becoming more aware of the airport's rhythms and patterns
2. His observations of boarding calls and the constant movement of people
3. The fleeting friendships he makes with kids who leave after short periods
4. His growing understanding of his own "stuck" situation in the "waiting area"
5. His internal reflections on why his life seems different from others
6. The contrast between the airport's constant departures and his stationary life

Tone: More introspective and contemplative, showing Miguel's growing awareness and philosophical thinking about his situation.

Focus on:
- The sounds and rhythms of the airport (boarding calls, announcements, footsteps)
- Miguel's observations of the patterns of human movement
- His attempts to make connections with other children
- His growing sense of being in a "waiting area" of life
- The bittersweet nature of temporary friendships
- His childlike but profound reflections on permanence vs. transience

End with Miguel sitting alone in the play area, listening to another boarding call, wondering when his own "departure" will come.

Do not include the episode title in the story.
