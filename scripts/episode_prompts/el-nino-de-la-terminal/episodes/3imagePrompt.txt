Miguel sitting by a large terminal window, folding paper airplanes while watching real planes take off and land on the runway. His face is lit with wonder and excitement as he holds up a paper airplane against the backdrop of a real aircraft. A friendly pilot in uniform is crouching down to give him an airline pin, their interaction warm and encouraging. The scene shows the contrast between Miguel's small paper creations and the massive planes outside. Bright sunlight streams through the window, creating a hopeful atmosphere. Miguel's collection of paper airplanes is scattered around him, and his expression shows his first real sense of aspiration and possibility.
