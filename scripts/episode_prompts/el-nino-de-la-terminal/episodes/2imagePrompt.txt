A contemplative scene of Miguel sitting alone in the airport play area, looking up at the departure board and flight information screens. The terminal is bustling with travelers rushing to their gates, while Miguel remains still and observant. His expression shows deep thought as he watches planes taxi on the runway through the large terminal windows. The scene captures the contrast between the constant movement around him and his stationary position. Bright airport lighting, diverse travelers in the background, and Miguel's thoughtful expression as he listens to boarding announcements and watches other children leave with their families.
