Miguel sitting alone in a school classroom, looking downcast while other children play together in the background. His expression shows shame and isolation. The scene contrasts with a smaller inset or memory of his mother working at the airport in her janitor's uniform. The classroom is bright and colorful, but Miguel appears withdrawn and sad. His backpack and school supplies are visible, and the overall atmosphere shows the social isolation he's experiencing after his classmates discovered his mother's job. The contrast between the school environment and his airport life is evident in his conflicted expression.
