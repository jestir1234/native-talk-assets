CHAPTER OUTLINE

Chapter 1: La sala de juegos
Miguel, still in elementary school, spends his days at the airport play area while his mother cleans nearby. He notices how other kids come and go with their families, but he always stays. One afternoon, he sees his mother being spoken to harshly by a passenger — she swallows her pride and keeps working. Miguel doesn’t fully understand, but it leaves a mark.

Chapter 2: Ecos en la terminal
Miguel begins to notice the rhythm of the airport: the boarding calls, the constant movement, the fleeting friendships he makes with kids who leave after an hour or two. He wonders why his life seems stuck in the “waiting area.”

Chapter 3: Aviones de papel
Inspired by the departing planes, Miguel starts folding paper airplanes. He dreams aloud about flying one day. A friendly pilot gives him a real airline pin, sparking his first sense of aspiration.

Chapter 4: La vergüenza escondida
At school, classmates discover his mother is a janitor. Some tease him. He feels shame and tries to hide where she works, even though deep down he admires her persistence.

Chapter 5: El custodio invisible
Miguel sneaks into the parts of the airport his mother cleans late at night. He sees how unnoticed she is, like the chairs and floors she polishes. For the first time, he realizes invisibility can be both painful and powerful.

Chapter 6: Amistades en tránsito
A summer brings a recurring friendship: a girl whose family travels often. For weeks, they play together whenever she passes through. Eventually she stops coming. Miguel learns the bittersweetness of transient bonds.

Chapter 7: Ventanas al cielo
Miguel grows into middle school. He starts sketching airplanes, airports, and even janitors in his notebooks. He begins to see the airport as more than a playground — it’s a stage of human stories.

Chapter 8: La turbulencia
As a teenager, Miguel fights with his mother. He resents their life of struggle and the feeling of being “left behind” while others are always departing. He considers dropping out of school, but a mentor (maybe the same pilot from years earlier) reminds him that runways exist so planes can take off.

Chapter 9: El último turno
Miguel accompanies his mother during her overnight cleaning shift. For the first time, he truly sees her exhaustion — and her quiet dignity. He helps her clean, and in the silence, he understands the depth of her sacrifices.

Chapter 10: Despegue
Now older, Miguel is ready to leave the airport behind — not in shame, but with gratitude. He prepares for his own journey (college, aviation school, or another dream). Before boarding, he folds one last paper airplane and leaves it in the play area where his childhood began.
