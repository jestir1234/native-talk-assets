You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Vietnamese-language story about Mai, a 28-year-old marketing manager in District 3, Ho Chi Minh City who is rediscovering her creative passion through photography and her connection with Linh, a street food photographer.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to Mai in an interesting way, showing her daily life with her mother, her work situation, and perhaps a moment that hints at her creative awakening.

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, contemplative, culturally rich, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
