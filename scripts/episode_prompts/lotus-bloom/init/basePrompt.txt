You are writing the first episode in a serialized Vietnamese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Mai
- Age: 28
- Location: District 3, Ho Chi Minh City
- Job: Marketing manager for a multinational beverage company
- Personality: Thoughtful, creative at heart but practical, caring, quietly observant
- Background: Mai lives in a small apartment with her mother who has early-stage dementia. She works in soulless corporate marketing but finds peace in photography and exploring alleyway cafés. She's recently met Linh, a street food photographer who inspires her to reconnect with her creative roots.

Tone: Quiet, introspective, contemplative with warm emotional undertones. The story should feel slice-of-life with subtle cultural elements of Vietnamese life in Ho Chi Minh City.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Vietnamese**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Mai's life involving her daily routine, her relationship with her mother, and perhaps a moment of creative inspiration. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
