You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Vietnamese-language story about Mai, a 28-year-old marketing manager in District 3, Ho Chi Minh City who is rediscovering her creative passion through photography and her connection with Linh, a street food photographer.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

Now, come up with the next episode idea. It should feel like the natural next chapter in an ongoing story. It can deepen character relationships, introduce a new twist, or expand on unresolved threads — but should avoid wrapping up the entire story.

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, contemplative, culturally rich, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
