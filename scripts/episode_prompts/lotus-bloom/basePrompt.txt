You are writing the next episode in a serialized Vietnamese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Mai  
- Age: 28  
- Location: District 3, Ho Chi Minh City  
- Job: Marketing manager for a multinational beverage company  
- Personality: Thoughtful, creative at heart but practical, caring, quietly observant  
- Background: Mai lives in a small apartment with her mother who has early-stage dementia. She works in soulless corporate marketing but finds peace in photography and exploring alleyway cafés. She's recently met Linh, a street food photographer who inspires her to reconnect with her creative roots.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

The story should feel slice-of-life, contemplative, with warm emotional undertones and subtle cultural elements of Vietnamese life in Ho Chi Minh City.

Write the Episode entirely in **Vietnamese**. It should be 400–600 characters long.
