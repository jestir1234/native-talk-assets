You are writing the first episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: [PROTAGONIST_NAME]
- Age: [PROTAGONIST_AGE]
- Location: [PROTAGONIST_LOCATION]
- Job: [PROTAGONIST_JOB]
- Personality: [PROTAGONIST_PERSONALITY]
- Background: [PROTAGONIST_BACKGROUND]

Tone: Quiet, introspective, sometimes dry or melancholic. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in [PROTAGONIST_NAME]'s life involving [FIRST_EPISODE_HOOK]. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
