You are writing the first episode in a serialized Chinese-language short story for beginner Chinese learners.

The main characters are:

- Name: 李明 (Li Ming) - Male protagonist
- Age: 28
- Location: Taipei, Luzhou district
- Job: Chef at a Chinese restaurant
- Personality: Hardworking, quiet, still has feelings for his ex but tries to hide it
- Background: Used to date his coworker 小美, but they broke up 6 months ago

- Name: 小美 (Xiao Mei) - Female protagonist  
- Age: 26
- Location: Taipei, Luzhou district
- Job: Waitress at the same Chinese restaurant
- Personality: Outgoing, sometimes flirty with customers, conflicted about her feelings
- Background: Used to date Li Ming, but they broke up. She initiated the breakup but still has lingering feelings

Tone: Quiet, introspective, with subtle tension and unresolved feelings. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, with emotional undercurrents about their complicated relationship. The vocabulary should be simple enough for beginner Chinese learners to understand.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Chinese**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a typical day at the restaurant where both characters are working together. Set the mood, introduce their voices, and hint at their emotional state and complicated relationship. Use simple vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for HSK 2-3 level learners.

This is a serialized story, so the world and characters will continue evolving from here.
