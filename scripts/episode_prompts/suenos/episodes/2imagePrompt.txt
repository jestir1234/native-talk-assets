Isabella and Don Miguel walking through the dream market, with Isabella holding Luna, a small glowing orb that emits a soft, timid light. The market background shows various dream orbs in different states - some bright and vibrant, others dim and fading. Don Miguel has a gentle, knowing expression as he watches Isabella connect with Luna. The scene should convey the emotional connection and the contrast between healthy and lost dreams.
