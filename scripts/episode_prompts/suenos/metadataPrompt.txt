You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Spanish-language story about Isabella, a 28-year-old dream merchant in El Mercado de los Sueños who can navigate the dream market and help others find their lost dreams.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

Now, come up with the next episode idea. It should feel like the natural next chapter in an ongoing story. It can deepen character relationships, introduce a new twist, or expand on unresolved threads — but should avoid wrapping up the entire story.

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
