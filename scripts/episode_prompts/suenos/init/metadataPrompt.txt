You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Spanish-language story about Isabella, a 28-year-old dream merchant in El Mercado de los Sueños who can navigate the dream market and help others find their lost dreams.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to the character in an interesting way. 

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
