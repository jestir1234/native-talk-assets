You are writing the first episode in a serialized Spanish-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Isabella
- Age: 28
- Location: El Mercado de los Sueños
- Job: Dream Merchant
- Personality: Curious, empathetic, slightly mysterious
- Background: A young woman who discovered she can navigate the dream market and help others find their lost dreams

Tone: Magical, introspective, warm with a touch of mystery. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, with subtle emotional undercurrents and a sense of wonder.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Spanish**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Isabella's life involving her first discovery of the dream market. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
