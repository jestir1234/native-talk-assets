A teenage Japanese boy sitting alone in his dimly lit bedroom, surrounded by swimming trophies and medals. He's in a depressed state, staring at the trophies with a mix of sadness and guilt. The room is messy, with school books untouched. A photo of his mother sits on the desk. The boy's posture shows defeat and isolation. The swimming trophies that once represented achievement now serve as painful reminders of broken dreams and his mother's unfulfilled wishes.
