You are writing Episode 5 of "Waves and Hoops" - a coming-of-age story about Kaito Nakamura, a former competitive swimmer who discovers basketball after losing his Olympic dreams. Write the story in Japanese from Kaito's first-person perspective.

CHARACTERS:
- Kaito Nakamura (中村 海翔): 16-year-old high school sophomore, 6'4", lanky, former competitive swimmer
- Coach Tanaka: Elderly, gruff-but-kind local swimming coach

EPISODE 5: "Shadows Beneath the Surface"
Setting: The ocean near Okinawa - Kaito trying to train in the sea

Write a 500-600 word episode that shows:
1. Kaito attempting to train in the ocean as an alternative to the pool
2. His initial confidence and determination to adapt
3. The different challenges of ocean swimming - waves, currents, salt water
4. A terrifying shark encounter that traumatizes him
5. His panic and escape from the water
6. The psychological impact - he's now afraid of water

Tone: Tense and frightening. Build suspense leading to the shark encounter, then show the psychological trauma.

Focus on:
- Kaito's determination to find a way to keep training
- The physical differences between pool and ocean swimming
- The beauty and danger of the ocean
- The shark encounter - sudden, terrifying, life-threatening
- Kaito's panic and survival instincts
- The lasting psychological impact - his fear of water now

End with Kaito sitting on the beach, shaking, realizing he can't even swim in the ocean anymore. His Olympic dreams seem completely out of reach.

Do not include the episode title in the story.
