You are writing Episode 2 of "Waves and Hoops" - a coming-of-age story about Kaito Nakamura, a former competitive swimmer who discovers basketball after losing his Olympic dreams. Write the story in Japanese.

CHARACTERS:
- Kaito Nakamura (中村 海翔): 16-year-old high school sophomore, 6'4", lanky, former competitive swimmer
- Aiko Nakamura: Kaito's late mother, former swim coach who instilled Olympic dreams
- Coach Tanaka: Elderly, gruff-but-kind local swimming coach

EPISODE 2: "Wishes from the Past"
Setting: Flashback to hospital room, then back to present day Okinawa

Write a 800-1000 word episode that shows:
1. A powerful flashback to Aiko's final moments in the hospital
2. Her dying wish for Kaito to keep swimming toward the Olympics
3. The emotional weight of this promise and how it haunts Kaito
4. Return to present day - Kaito at home, looking at his mother's photo
5. His internal struggle with the weight of her expectations
6. Coach Tanaka calling to check on him, showing concern

Tone: Deeply emotional and introspective. The flashback should be heart-wrenching but not melodramatic. Show the love between mother and son.

Focus on:
- The hospital scene - Aiko's weak voice, her determination, her love for Kaito
- The specific words she uses about Olympic dreams
- Kaito's present-day guilt and determination to honor her memory
- The contrast between past dreams and present reality
- Coach Tanaka's gentle but persistent support

End with Kaito making a silent promise to his mother's photo, then looking out the window at the pool in the distance.
