A coastal town under dark, stormy skies as a typhoon approaches. A teenage Japanese boy standing at the edge of an Olympic swimming pool, looking determined despite the ominous weather. Dark clouds gather overhead, and palm trees sway in the wind. The pool water is slightly choppy from the wind. The boy has a resolute expression as he prepares for his final swim before the storm. The scene captures the tension between nature's power and human determination.
