You are writing a standalone episode in a serialized short story about **Zoey Yamashita**, a sarcastic and emotionally distant woman in her 20s who is secretly a 400-year-old zombie living in modern Tokyo. She looks human but must eat raw meat to maintain her appearance. She is fluent in many languages, highly intelligent, and has lived many lives across different historical eras.
The story is meant to be read by non-english speakers, so please write in a way that is easy to understand for them.

Zoey's inner world is melancholic, witty, and full of dry humor. She hides her condition from most people, and constantly struggles with boredom, isolation, and existential dread.

Recurring characters include:
- **Haruka**: Zoey's upbeat best friend who doesn't know her secret.
- **Kenji**: A butcher who secretly helps her get meat.
- **Lex**: Another immortal zombie who enjoys being undead.
- **Takashi**: A bookstore owner Zoey is quietly attracted to.
- **Detective Kuroda**: A cop who's suspicious of Zoey's odd behavior.

Each chapter is a self-contained "slice of life" day in Zoey's world, showing her navigating awkward, funny, or dark situations related to being an undead person hiding in plain sight.
