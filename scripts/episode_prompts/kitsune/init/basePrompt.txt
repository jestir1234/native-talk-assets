You are writing the first episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Yuki
- Age: Unknown (appears to be in her 20s)
- Location: Rural Japan, near a small mountain village
- Job: Fox spirit who pretends to be human
- Personality: Playful, curious, mischievous but kind-hearted, loves learning about human culture
- Background: A young fox spirit who discovered she can transform into human form. Fascinated by human life, she decides to live among them secretly, learning their customs and trying to blend in while maintaining her fox nature.

Tone: Quiet, introspective, sometimes dry or melancholic. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Yuki's life involving her first attempt to blend in with humans in the village. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
