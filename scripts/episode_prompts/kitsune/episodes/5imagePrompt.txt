A rural Japanese village during a sudden rainstorm. A young woman in her 20s stands in the rain, looking startled and conflicted. She's caught between her fox instincts (which want her to run and hide) and her human disguise. In the background, Old Man Tanaka stands in the doorway of his tea shop, gesturing for her to come inside for shelter. The rain is heavy and dramatic, creating a tense atmosphere. The young woman's expression shows her internal struggle - part of her wants to bolt like a fox, but she's trying to maintain her human composure. The scene should capture the dramatic tension of Yuki's close call with revealing her true nature.
