A village street in rural Japan during the afternoon. A young woman in her 20s stands nervously, talking to an older woman (Mrs. Sato) who has a suspicious, probing expression. The older woman is leaning forward slightly, as if trying to get closer to the truth. The young woman has a slightly defensive posture, with her fox instincts making her ears twitch subtly. The street has traditional Japanese houses in the background, and the afternoon light creates shadows that add to the tense atmosphere. The scene should capture the nervous energy of Yuki trying to maintain her disguise while being interrogated by the suspicious Mrs. Sato.
