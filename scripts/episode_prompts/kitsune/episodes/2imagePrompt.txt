A cozy traditional Japanese tea shop interior. A young woman in her 20s sits at a low table, looking slightly nervous as she tries to use chopsticks. An elderly man (Old Man Tanaka) sits across from her with a kind, patient expression. The tea shop has warm lighting, traditional Japanese decor, and steam rising from teacups. The young woman has a concentrated expression as she struggles with the chopsticks, and there might be a hint of her fox nature showing through - perhaps her ears twitching or a slight tail movement. The scene should feel warm and inviting, with a touch of humor at Yuki's attempts to act human.
