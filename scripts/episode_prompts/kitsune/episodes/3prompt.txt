You are writing Episode 3 of "きつねのにんげんごっこ" - a story about Yuki, a young fox spirit who transforms into human form to experience human life. Write the story in Japanese from Yuki's first-person perspective. Use simple, beginner-friendly Japanese vocabulary and grammar that a language learner can understand.

CHARACTERS:
- Yuki: Young fox spirit in human form, curious, playful, nervous about being discovered
- Old Man Tanaka: Kind elderly villager who runs a small tea shop
- Mrs. Sato: Nosy neighbor who suspects something is different about Yuki

EPISODE 3: "佐藤さんの疑い"
Setting: The village street, afternoon

Write a 200-400 character episode that shows:
1. Yuki walking through the village, feeling more confident
2. Her encounter with Mrs. Sato, the nosy neighbor
3. Mrs. Sato's suspicious questions about Yuki's background
4. Yuki's nervous attempts to answer convincingly
5. Her fox instincts helping her sense danger
6. How she manages to avoid revealing her secret

Tone: Tense and nervous, with moments of clever fox-like thinking. Show the contrast between Yuki's growing confidence and the threat of discovery.

Focus on:
- Yuki's growing comfort in the village
- Mrs. Sato's suspicious nature and probing questions
- Yuki's clever use of her fox instincts to sense danger
- Her nervous but convincing responses
- The tension of almost being discovered
- Her relief when she successfully avoids suspicion

End with Yuki feeling both relieved and more cautious about her disguise, realizing that not all humans are as kind as Old Man Tanaka.

Use simple Japanese vocabulary and grammar suitable for beginner learners. Avoid complex kanji and advanced grammar structures.

Do not include the episode title in the story.
