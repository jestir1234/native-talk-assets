A small rural Japanese village in the early morning. A young woman in her 20s with a curious, slightly nervous expression stands at the edge of the village, looking around with wonder. She has subtle fox-like features that she's trying to hide - perhaps slightly pointed ears or a hint of a tail. The village has traditional Japanese houses with thatched roofs, and there's a small tea shop in the background. The morning light is soft and golden, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. The scene should capture the beauty of rural Japan and Yuki's sense of wonder and nervousness about her new human life.
