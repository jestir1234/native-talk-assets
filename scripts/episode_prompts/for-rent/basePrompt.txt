You are writing the next episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Emiko Tanaka  
- Age: 27  
- Location: Tokyo  
- Job: A “gig worker for rent” on an app where people can hire her for various one-off jobs (like walking with someone, being a fake date, helping with chores, listening to people rant, etc.)  
- Personality: Sarcastic, emotionally guarded, highly observant  
- Background: Emiko used to be a literature student, but dropped out and now drifts from gig to gig. She lives alone in a small apartment and keeps mostly to herself.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents.

Write the Episode entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400–600 characters long.
