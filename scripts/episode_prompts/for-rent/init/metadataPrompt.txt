You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Japanese-language story about Emiko, a 27-year-old woman in Tokyo who picks up odd jobs through a gig work app. She takes all kinds of temporary work — from pet-sitting and furniture assembly to flyering and stand-in acting — and encounters all sorts of people and situations across the city.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to the character in an interesting way. 

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
