You are writing the first episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Emiko Tanaka  
- Age: 27  
- Location: Tokyo  
- Job: A “gig worker for rent” on an app where people can hire her for various one-off jobs (like walking with someone, being a fake date, helping with chores, listening to people rant, etc.)  
- Personality: Sarcastic, emotionally guarded, highly observant  
- Background: Emiko used to be a literature student, but dropped out and now drifts from gig to gig. She lives alone in a small apartment and keeps mostly to herself.

Tone: Quiet, introspective, sometimes dry or melancholic. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, humorous, with subtle emotional undercurrents.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Emiko’s life involving one gig job. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
