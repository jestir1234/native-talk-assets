You are writing the next episode in a serialized Korean-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Bo-mi (보미)
- Age: 24
- Location: Seoul, South Korea
- Job: Part-time cat café worker, secret Instagram influencer
- Personality: Creative, anxious, socially awkward, secretly romantic but afraid of real relationships
- Background: Runs a viral Instagram account where she photoshops her cat into romantic couple poses. Her fans think she has a perfect love life, but she hasn't dated anyone since college. When her fake "boyfriend" gets doxxed, she recruits her weird neighbor, a metal guitarist named Min-seok, to pretend to be her boyfriend.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

The story should feel slice-of-life, humorous, with awkward social situations and subtle emotional undercurrents. Include elements of influencer culture, social media pressure, and the contrast between online persona and real life.

Write the Episode entirely in **Korean**. It should be 400–600 characters long.
