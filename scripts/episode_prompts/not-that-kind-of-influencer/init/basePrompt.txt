You are writing the first episode in a serialized Korean-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: Bo-mi (보미)
- Age: 24
- Location: Seoul, South Korea
- Job: Part-time cat café worker, secret Instagram influencer
- Personality: Creative, anxious, socially awkward, secretly romantic but afraid of real relationships
- Background: Runs a viral Instagram account where she photoshops her cat into romantic couple poses. Her fans think she has a perfect love life, but she hasn't dated anyone since college. When her fake "boyfriend" gets doxxed, she recruits her weird neighbor, a metal guitarist named Min-seok, to pretend to be her boyfriend.

Tone: Humorous, awkward, with social media culture elements. The story should feel slice-of-life, light-hearted, with subtle emotional undercurrents and the contrast between online persona and real life.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Korean**. It should be 400–600 characters long, and describe a day in Bo-mi's life involving her Instagram influencer activities and the pressure of maintaining her fake relationship. Set the mood, introduce her voice, and hint at her emotional state. No need to explain everything—let her character come through naturally.

This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
