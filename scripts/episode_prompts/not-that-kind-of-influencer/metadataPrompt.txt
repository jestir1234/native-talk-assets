You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Korean-language story about Bo-mi (보미), a 24-year-old part-time cat café worker and secret Instagram influencer in Seoul who photoshops her cat into romantic couple poses.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

Now, come up with the next episode idea. It should feel like the natural next chapter in an ongoing story. It can deepen character relationships, introduce a new twist, or expand on unresolved threads — but should avoid wrapping up the entire story.

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best. Focus on the contrast between online persona and real life, awkward social situations, and influencer culture.
