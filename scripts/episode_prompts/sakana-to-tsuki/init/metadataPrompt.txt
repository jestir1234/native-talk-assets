You are a creative assistant helping write a serialized Japanese-language story about a lonely fish who dreams of visiting the moon and asks other sea creatures for advice on how to reach it.

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally.

Now, come up with the first episode idea. It should introduce the audience to the character in an interesting way. 

Return:
- A creative episode title
- A short plot hook (1–2 sentences) describing what happens in the episode
- A very short (10 words or fewer) description of the episode

The tone should feel organic and evolving — you can make it warm, dramatic, mysterious, funny, or bittersweet depending on what fits best.
