You are writing the first episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: A lonely fish (no specific name given)
- Age: Young fish
- Location: The ocean
- Job: Just a fish swimming in the sea
- Personality: Lonely, dreamy, determined, curious, imaginative
- Background: Lives alone in the ocean and has become fascinated with the moon

Tone: Charming, whimsical, gentle, with a touch of wonder and innocence. The story should feel like a children's fable but with depth and heart.

Write Episode 1 entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400â€“600 characters long, and describe the fish's loneliness and his dream of visiting the moon. Set the mood, introduce his character, and show his determination to find a way to reach the moon. This is a serialized story, so the world and character will continue evolving from here.
