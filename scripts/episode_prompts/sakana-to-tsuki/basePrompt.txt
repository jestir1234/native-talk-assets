You are writing the next episode in a serialized Japanese-language short story.

The protagonist is:

- Name: A lonely fish (no specific name given)
- Age: Young fish
- Location: The ocean
- Job: Just a fish swimming in the sea
- Personality: Lonely, dreamy, determined, curious, imaginative
- Background: Lives alone in the ocean and has become fascinated with the moon

The story is continuous and should evolve naturally. Use the following summary of what has happened so far to inform what comes next:

${PAST_SUMMARY}

The story should feel charming, whimsical, gentle, with a touch of wonder and innocence. It should feel like a children's fable but with depth and heart.

Write the Episode entirely in **Japanese**. It should be 400â€“600 characters long.
